Ryan Keats

Overview

This project contains an analysis of relevant data from the Box Office over the last decade. 
Throughout this document you will find a summary of films that have succeeded at the Box Office. Showcasing total gross, most popular genres and movie ratings to assist Microsoft in determining which types of films their studio should pursue in producing. 
The results of this analysis show that sequels, prequels and remakes seem to be best received at the Box Office. 
Microsoft can use this analysis as a starting point to help narrow their target market and focus on which type of film to produce.
 
Business Problem




Microsoft has seen the success of other big companies in developing video content and have decided to create a new movie studio. 
In order to assist Microsoft, get their new movie studio up and running, an analysis of the Box Office has been provided. This analysis will help Microsoft create a new studio, find what is considered best practice and minimise the risks of production failure.








Data

Microsoft is one of the largest and most successful companies in the world and have plenty of resources to start out in the film industry. 
The Data sets provided show the best grossing movies of the last decade, the most popular genres of films and the ratings that these films are receiving from viewers.

Methods

Descriptive analysis has been used throughout this project, whilst looking at what has happened in the Box Office over a decade of films being produced. In doing so it has been a helpful tool in displaying which films and genres have been most successful, to better gauge the industry Microsoft are considering venturing into.

Results

The most successful films of the last decade from a financial perspective are part of large movie Franchises, such as Star Wars and The Marvel Universe (MCU). Including in that high success are Sequels, Prequels and remakes of original films.



















Another outcome of the analysis into the Movie industry shows the production rate per annum, averaging over 376 films produced per year. In contrast, the top Film studios have only produced a fraction of those films per year, which indicates there is still space to enter the market for Microsoft's new studio.







Conclusions 

This analysis has led to three recommendations for assisting Microsoft create a new Movie studio:

- Embark on research into popular Sequels, prequels and remakes as they have been the standouts at the top of the gross data when looking at the success of the Box Office over the last decade. This may also assist in the initial success of a new studio alleviating additional pressure of producing original content.

- Endeavour at working within a designated runtime, as the average runtime of films is just short of an hour and a half (90 minutes). Using that as a parameter to assist in determining what will be an optimal duration of Microsoft’s films. 

- Create a refined budget for the total production costs of film making, as the top studios are producing upwards of 100 films per annum. This could help minimise Microsoft’s risk of production failure and potential revenue loss.



Next steps

Further analysis could be beneficial to the success of Microsoft’s new Movie Studio:

- Further analysis into ratings by undertaking Market Research. Upon reviewing the available data this project has highlighted the limitation of true results, because votes are not assigned to individual films nor is there a consistent number of voters leading to the data being misconstrued.

- Investigate the expenditure of producing films in order to accurately define the budget required to open a new movie studio. This information will also provide Microsoft with the ability to complete a Cost Benefit Analysis, to help determine if this is a worthwhile venture to undertake and assist in maximising return on investment. 

- Complete a comprehensive Competitor Analysis, this analysis could be advantageous to Microsoft in identifying the strengths and weaknesses of their potential competitors and any opportunities or threats in the film industry.
